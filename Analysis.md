## Question 1: Analysis of sneaker shop AOV

#### Prompt

*Given some sample data, write a program to answer the following: [click

*On Shopify, we have exactly 100 sneaker shops, and each of these shops
sells only one model of shoe. We want to do some analysis of the average
order value (AOV). When we look at orders data over a 30 day window, we
naively calculate an AOV of $3145.13. Given that we know these shops are
selling sneakers, a relatively affordable item, something seems wrong
with our analysis.*

#### Getting Started

This analysis requires **R** to be installed. If it is not installed,
please visit [r-project.org](https://www.r-project.org/) to download the
latest version.

This analysis requires the *tidyverse* **R** package. If *tidyverse* is
not installed, this analysis will ask for your permission to install
*tidyverse*.

To ensure this analysis is reproducible, a series of scripts (see
[Appendix](#s3)) are run to initialize the environment and load the
`2019 Winter Data Science Intern Challenge Data Set.xlsx` excel file
into R.

``` r
# NB: If any required packages are missing and you are running this code block
# within an R Notebook, it will fail to execute properly. This behaviour is
# intentional and acts as a safety mechanism to ensure the user provides
# explicit consent before installing packages. If this occurs and you wish to
# install the packages, copy the code below into your terminal or console, then
# continue with the rest of this document.
