This project contains two parts: 

1. an R Markdown document (knitted to HTML, see link above) on the 2019 Winter Data Science Intern Challenge Data Set; and 
2. an R script ("program") that produces a .csv file of summary statistics and an interactive HTML histogram-density plot.

It is ***strongly recommended*** that you download and view the report. The report contains my **full thought process**, **interactive visualizations**, and **complete answers for Questions 1 and 2**.

To run the automated analysis, download this repository and run the following command:

```{bash, eval = FALSE}

cd /path/to/repository
Rscript run.R

```
