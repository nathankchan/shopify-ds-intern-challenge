***

This project contains two parts: 

1. an **R Markdown document** (already knit to HTML, see link above); and 
2. an **R script** ("program") that saves two files to `./output`: 
    + a .csv file of summary statistics; and 
    + an interactive HTML histogram-density plot.

It is ***strongly recommended*** that you [download and view the report](https://github.com/nathankchan/shopify-ds-intern-challenge/raw/main/Analysis.html) (option 1). 

The report contains my **full thought process**, **interactive visualizations**, and **complete answers for Questions 1 and 2**.

To run the automated analysis (option 2), download this repository and run the following command in your terminal:

```{bash, eval = FALSE}

cd /path/to/repository
Rscript run.R

```
