## Description

This project contains three parts: 

1. an **R Markdown document** (already knit to HTML, see [here](https://nathankchan.github.io/shopify-ds-intern-challenge/Analysis.html)); 
2. an **R Shiny app** ("program") that provides an interactive GUI that produces histogram-density plots and reports key metrics; and
3. an **R script** that saves two files to `./output`: 
    + a .csv file of summary statistics; and 
    + an interactive HTML histogram-density plot.

It is ***strongly recommended*** that you [view the report](https://nathankchan.github.io/shopify-ds-intern-challenge/Analysis.html) (option 1). 

The report contains my **full thought process**, **interactive visualizations**, and **complete answers for Questions 1 and 2**.

To run the Shiny app or R script (options 2 or 3), [download the repository](https://github.com/nathankchan/shopify-ds-intern-challenge) and run the following command in your terminal. Note that you must have R installed for the app/script to execute.

```

cd /path/to/repository

# To run the Shiny app
Rscript app.R

# To run the R script (see script for usage information and optional arguments)
Rscript run.R

```
