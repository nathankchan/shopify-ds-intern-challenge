This project contains two parts: 

1. an **R Markdown document** (already knit to HTML, see [here](https://nathankchan.github.io/shopify-ds-intern-challenge/Analysis.html)); and 
2. an **R script** ("program") that saves two files to `./output`: 
    + a .csv file of summary statistics; and 
    + an interactive HTML histogram-density plot.

It is ***strongly recommended*** that you [view the report](https://nathankchan.github.io/shopify-ds-intern-challenge/Analysis.html) (option 1). 

The report contains my **full thought process**, **interactive visualizations**, and **complete answers for Questions 1 and 2**.

To run the automated analysis (option 2), [download the repository](https://github.com/nathankchan/shopify-ds-intern-challenge) and run the following command in your terminal. Note that you must have R installed for the script to execute.

```

cd /path/to/repository
Rscript run.R

```
